# 3D Fabric
Application for creating digital textiles for 3D printing.

It was developed as a part of my bachelor thesis about 3D printed fabric. The implementation takes into consideration the chosen 3D printer (Fortus 250mc) which uses ABSplus-P430 as a material. All generated meshes were successfully printed using this printer.
